// The user's answers 2 and 3 (2026-10-26): a spell-cast card counts partial when a note adds a rule the cast doesn't play
// (src/compiler/honest.js withCastNotes), not when it only restates the spell; a note-only item counts done once its text was checked
// for anything a card could play (src/compiler/notes-checked.js).
